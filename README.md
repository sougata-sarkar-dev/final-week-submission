Model Summary:
-------------
Model Type: RandomForestRegressor
Best Parameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}
Final RMSE on Test Set: 0.0059464733066359465
Final R² Score on Test Set: 0.9993704792244689

Key Findings:
-------------
- The model is a Random Forest Regressor.
- The R² score of 0.9994 indicates that the model explains a high percentage of the variance in the target variable.
- The RMSE of 0.0059 suggests that the model's predictions are relatively close to the actual values.
- Feature importance analysis shows that 'Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins' is the most important feature in predicting the target variable.
- The distribution of residuals is centered around zero, suggesting that the model's errors are randomly distributed.
